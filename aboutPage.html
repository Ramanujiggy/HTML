            <p>Just to provide a little bit of background on me, my name is Robert Gelin. I'm originally from Haiti (moved to the states when i was about four,
              my father went to graduate school here) I've grown up almost entirely in Fargo,
               North Dakota and have developed a very begrudging admiration for the "winter lifestyle". My intention with this blog is to document
               my self education into web development and design, among other things. I will have non web development content on here (My primary occupation is Contact Center Operations), but i will keep that mostly
               related to any interesting projects that i encounter or any interesting techincal issues i encounter.  I will keep the details vague as I don't want to divulge sensitive business information.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you for taking the time to go through my portfolio site/blog! I hope what i have here is interesting to you.</p>
